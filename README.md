## Instructions
* Play proceeds as follows:
  * The user arrives at the landing page and is presented with a call-to-action to "Start Quiz."
  * Clicking the "Start Quiz" button presents the user with a series of questions. The timer is initialized with a value and immediately begins countdown.
  * Score is calculated by time remaining. Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score. Answering incorrectly results in a time penalty (10 seconds are subtracted from time remaining).
  * When time runs out and/or all questions are answered, the user is presented with their final score and asked to enter their initials. Their final score and initials are then stored in `localStorage`.
